We've just pushed an update that fixes the infamous remote code execution exploit that has been affected by 1.7 and above of Vanilla Minecraft. Any client that has not fixed it should be considered unsafe to use. <b>CheatBreaker+ Services will be returning around Christmas time or soon after that as well.</b> I am the only one working on this project as of now, so keep that in mind. :)"
