With this, the issue that stood before with account issues should be resolved, if you have any further standing account issues, login using the CheatBreaker launcher. We've been hard at work on the client recently and we appreciate the support we've been receiving from you guys. We're excited for the release of 1.8.9, and we're almost ready. <br> <br> Stay tuned. <br> <br><u><i>https://oldcheatbreaker.com/discord</i></u>"
